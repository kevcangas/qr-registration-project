            Where did the idea come from?
        </h2>
        <p class="justify">
            This app was made to solve a problematic that raised in a school where the students
            are studying in a workgroup while a teacher is with them supervising how they are 
            doing his activities. When the students entry on the workgroup, the teacher registries
            the time when they started, their names and when they finished, the teacher registries
            the time. Also, the administration requires the number of students in every workgroup
            to distribute better the students.
